# QuickPak Professional Resurrected

The original QuickPak Professional add-on was the absolute *best* product for writing professional applications using QB4.5/PDS7.1 in the late-1980s and early-1990s. It was touted as *The Most Comprehensive Collection of BASIC Tools Ever Produced*.

QuickPak Professional for QB4.5/PDS7.1/VBDOS1.0 (MS-DOS) was released into the *public domain* around the end of 2018 by [Gene Buckle](https://github.com/geneb). This project serves to resurrect much of the functionality (where possible) for use with QB64 v2.1+ (MIT License).

You can find the original QuickPak Professional installation [here](http://annex.retroarchive.org/crescent/index.html) along with a [PDF copy of the manual](http://annex.retroarchive.org/crescent/QuickPak%20Professional.pdf). You can also access the [original repo here](https://github.com/geneb/QuickPak-Pro-DOS).

We also want to thank [Gene Buckle](https://github.com/geneb) for making this all possible as well as to [Ethan Winer](http://ethanwiner.com/fullmoon.html) for creating the product in the first place.
